									That’s a reality that people with visually-triggered vestibular disorders have to deal with. As animated interfaces increasingly become the norm, more people have begun to notice that large-scale motion on screen can cause them dizziness, nausea, headaches, or worse. For some, the symptoms can last long after the animation is over. Yikes.</p>
<p>
The idea that animation in our interfaces is capable of making our users dizzy wasn’t something we had to contend with much when the web was predominantly a static medium. It’s actually a fairly new revelation in most tech circles. Even Apple discovered this the hard way when the animated transitions in iOS 7 started making some people sick. Just like other elements of design, the way you use animation can have an impact on how accessible the end product is to your audience, especially if they suffer from a vestibular disorder.</p>
<p>
A vesti-what disorder?
Any disease, damage, or injury to the vestibular system—the system around our inner ear and brain that processes sensory information involved in controlling balance and eye movements—falls under the umbrella of a vestibular disorder. There is a long list of specific vestibular disorders, including benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) and labyrinthitis. The a11y project discusses the definition of vestibular disorders as well.</p>
<p>
These disorders can affect people of all ages, and the severity and symptoms vary from individual to individual. Estimating an exact number of people touched by this, let alone what percentage of your specific audience may be affected, can be difficult to pin down. According to vestibular.org, approximately 8 million American adults report a chronic problem with balance, while an additional 2.4 million report a chronic problem with dizziness.</p>
<p>
It’s also worth noting that people with vestibular disorders aren’t the only ones who can be potentially triggered by animation on screen. Animations can have an impact on those with epilepsy and migraine sensitivities as well.</p>
<p>
Identifying potentially triggering animation
To get a better idea of what sorts of web animation are triggering for people with vestibular disorders, I chatted with Greg Tarnoff and Craig Grannell about their experiences. Greg, who experiences vertigo and migraines, is an accessibility and UX consultant, writer, and speaker. Craig, who experiences dizziness, is a writer and editor who has written about the effects of iOS’s animations for publications like the Guardian. Both of them have been vocal about how interface animations affect people with vestibular disorders.</p>

								<p>Huge's Josh Payton outlines five key design principles that will stand you in good stead – no matter what the future holds.</p>
<p>
I was younger than I can remember when my parents bought our family an Apple IIe computer. When I was 11 I thought Chuck Yeager’s Air Combat was the coolest thing I'd ever seen.</p>
<p>
At 19 I was on Makeoutclub, three years before Myspace was cool. It was only 10 years ago that the Motorola Razr was the hottest phone on the market, and it's top selling point was simply that it was thin. Now I'm in my mid thirties, and I've outgrown so much of the technology that has consistently changed the way we make sense of things.</p>
<p>
Josh Payton will be speaking about the future of UX and the rise of the digital polymath at Generate London - get your ticket today
In only 20 years we've gone from marvelling at the revolutionary concept of the hyperlink and dial-up access to living in a world of wearable computers, anticipatory design, and the emergence of cyborg-level augmentation of our physical capabilities. Because of this, the most common questions I'm regularly faced with revolve around where our technological path is taking us and how companies, designers, and developers can keep up.</p>
<p>
Making predictions about the future has a funny way of making one look foolish, but there are some enduring principles that I think transcend whatever prevailing industry trope is en vogue.</p>
<p>
01. Humanise your mission

Most designers are familiar with the concept of a user-first approach, and this empathetic attitude towards product creation should touch every corner of an organisation.</p>
<p>
In 1980 Bill Gates stated Microsoft's mission as: "A computer on every desk and in every home." He understood that his mission statement had to clearly express Microsoft's objectives in a way that could easily be measured and was relevant to everyone, from his employees to his suppliers to his customers. In a time when computers were perceived as daunting and complicated, he set forth a goal that anyone could understand and alluded to the approachable future of computing Microsoft intended to enable..</p>
